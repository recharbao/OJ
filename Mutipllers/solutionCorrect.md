An other formula for the product of the divisors of N is N ** (D/ 2), where D is the number of divisors and may be found from your map count by taking the product of entry->second + 1 for every entry.

This does raise the question of what to do when D is odd, which it would be if N is a perfect square. In that case it is easy to compute sqrt(N) (the exponents would all be even, so you can halve them all and take the product of the primes to half of their original exponents), and then raise sqrt(N) to the power of D. Essentially this changes N ** (D / 2) into (N ** (1 / 2)) ** D.

For example if N = 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 (one of the examples), then D will be (2 + 1) * (1 + 1) = 6 and the product of divisors will be 12 ** (6 / 2) = 1728.

Computing N (or its square root) should done modulo mod. Computing D should be done modulo mod - 1 (the totient of mod, mod is a prime so its totient is just one less). mod - 1 is even, so we could not have computed the modular multiplicative inverse of 2 to "divide" D by 2 that way. When N is a square then AFAIK we're really stuck with computing its square root (that's not so bad, but multiplying by a half would have been easier).
